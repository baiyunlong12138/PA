# A Library of generic reactions

How to generically obtain products from a given list of reactants, which share the same property, is one of the biggest problems in the chemical industry.
One can understand the term same property here as: these reactants have the same sub-structure, which means they have a similar reaction pattern.


In this tutorial, a generic molecular generator will be introduced. With this generator the users can define the sub-structure as needed, as well the reaction pattern. The generator can auto detect the given sub-structure among the reactants, then converting them based on the given pattern to products. 

With the help of generator, users can obtain a list of all possible products.

In order to have a better understanding of the generator, three different Languages will be introduced: **SMILES**, **SMARTS** and **SMIRKS**. As well as a common used cheminformatics library **RDkit**.
