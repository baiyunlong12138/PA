# Introduction to RDkit

RDKit is a toolkit for cheminformatics and molecular modeling. It provides a wide range of functions and tools for working with chemical structures, compounds, reactions, and related data. 
*Our Generator is mostly based on functions from RDkit*, which means RDkit is super important for users to understand how the generator works.

First, let's have a generall introduction of RDkit:



**1. Purpose and Scope:**
RDKit is designed to facilitate the manipulation, analysis, and visualization of chemical structures and data. It aims to support chemists and researchers in various aspects of their work, including drug discovery, compound database management, virtual screening, property prediction, and molecular visualization.

**2. Key Features:**

- **Structure Handling:** RDKit can read, write, and manipulate molecular structures in various file formats, including SMILES, SDF, Mol2, and PDB. It can handle complex molecules, polymers, and macromolecules.
  
- **Chemical Descriptors and Properties:** RDKit calculates a wide range of chemical descriptors, including molecular weight, logP, PSA, and more. These descriptors are important for understanding a molecule's properties and behavior.

- **Chemical Reaction Handling:** RDKit supports reactions and transformations. It can parse reaction SMILES, perform reaction enumeration, and generate reactant/product SMARTS patterns.

- **Substructure and Similarity Searching:** RDKit enables substructure and similarity searches within compound databases. This is essential for identifying molecules with specific structural features or properties.

- **3D Structure Generation:** RDKit can generate 3D molecular structures and perform energy minimization to optimize molecular geometry. This is crucial for understanding molecular conformations and interactions.

- **Visualization:** RDKit provides tools for visualizing chemical structures, reactions, and properties. It supports 2D and 3D visualization, allowing users to view molecules from different angles.

- **Molecular Fingerprinting:** RDKit can generate molecular fingerprints that represent structural and topological features. These fingerprints are used for similarity searching, clustering, and machine learning.

- **Machine Learning Integration:** RDKit can be integrated with machine learning libraries to develop predictive models for various chemical properties, such as solubility, toxicity, and activity.

**3. Programming Languages:**
RDKit is primarily available for Python and C++. The Python API is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of integration with other scientific libraries and tools. It allows chemists and researchers to write scripts and workflows to automate various tasks.

**4. Usage:**
RDKit finds applications in several domains:

- **Drug Discovery:** RDKit assists in compound library design, virtual screening, hit identification, lead optimization, and ADME/Tox prediction.
  
- **Chemical Informatics:** It's used for compound database management, similarity searching, substructure screening, and property prediction.
  
- **Materials Science:** RDKit is employed in polymer and materials research for analyzing molecular structures and properties.
  
- **Education and Research:** RDKit is a valuable tool for researchers, educators, and students in chemistry-related fields to explore chemical concepts, visualize molecules, and analyze data.

**5. Install RDkit**
Simply use command `pip install RDkit` before using the generator, or use `conda install -c conda-forge rdkit` if you are using conda envirnment.
